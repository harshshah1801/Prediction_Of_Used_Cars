## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to assist consumers in making informed decisions when purchasing used cars. We perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and employ machine learning techniques, particularly decision tree regression, to predict the prices of used cars. The analysis also considers factors such as environmental impact, fuel efficiency, and company reputation to provide a holistic view for prospective buyers.

## Data
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and includes various attributes of used cars, such as brand, location, year, mileage, engine power, fuel type, and more.

- **Source:** [Kaggle Used Cars Price Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/avikasliwal/used-cars-price-prediction)
- **Attributes:** Brand, Location, Year, Distance covered, Fuel type, Transmission, Owner type, Mileage, Engine, Power, Seats, Prices, etc.

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**  
   - Handling missing values, data type conversions, and unit standardization.
   - Feature engineering to extract useful variables like company name and pollution factor.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Visualization of key variables such as mileage, engine power, and fuel type.
   - Analysis of price distribution across different regions and car companies.

3. **Model Training:**  
   - Implemented various regression models including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest Regression.
   - Hyperparameter tuning and PCA were performed to improve model performance.

4. **Prediction:**  
   - The final model was selected based on performance metrics like RMSE and R² score.

## Results
- The decision tree regressor with hyperparameter tuning provided the best performance with an R² score of 0.48.
- Key factors influencing car prices include kilometers driven, fuel type, mileage, engine power, and owner type.
- Visualizations and predictive models help in understanding the best options for used cars based on different user requirements.
